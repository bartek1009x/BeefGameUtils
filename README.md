# Beef Game Utils

This is a collection of some classes from LibGDX that I personally use in my game, ported from Java to Beef. **Not** a port of the entire framework.

Planned ports from LibGDX:
- Timer,
- AssetManager.

The changes from the original LibGDX code include the removal of some functions that I personally don't use and obviously changes in syntax and used std functions to adapt it to Beef.
